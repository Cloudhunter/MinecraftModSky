# `nederlandskie`

Potentially, a Bluesky feed of people speaking some language while living in some other country (for example, Russian-speaking people living in Netherlands).

Heavily WIP. Doesn't work yet at all, but does read the stream of posts as they are created on Bluesky.

## Roadmap

- [x] Reading stream of posts from Bluesky
- [ ] Storing posts and profiles in the database
- [ ] Detecting the country of residence from profile information
- [ ] Serving the feed
- [ ] Publishing the feed
- [ ] Handling deleting of posts

## Running

`cargo run`
